# Phase 2 — Schema Design

## Tasks Completed
- Created metrics_schema.py — TaskType enum, ClassificationMetrics, RegressionMetrics, and `validate_metrics_by_task()` helper
- Created request_schema.py — TrainingLogEntry, ExperimentMetadata, EvaluationRequest (with task-aware metric validation), and DataEvaluationMetadata
- Created report_schema.py — EvaluationSource, RiskLevel, ReportMetadata, ReportContent, and EvaluationReport
- Created response_schema.py — ResponseStatus, EvaluationResponse, and ErrorResponse
- All schemas are synchronous Pydantic models (no async needed — pure validation logic)
- Local commit
- Pushed phase 2 to githu
